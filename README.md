# The world's first automated notion spaced repetition system

You may want to get into spaced repetition and use it to achieve your goals, but if you're anything like me, you'll forget you had to do review to stop forgetting what you're trying to remember. 
This notion system stops that from happening - you get text message and email reminders every day telling you which tasks you need to review.
